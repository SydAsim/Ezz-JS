XML (Extensible Markup Language) is a markup language similar to HTML, 
but without predefined tags to use. Instead, you define your own tags 
designed specifically for your needs. This is a powerful way to store data 
in a format that can be stored, searched, and shared.05x

****AJAX = Asynchronous programming technique, not tied to XML.
*Send a request to the server without reloading the page.
*Receive a response (in any format such as JSON, XML, plain text, or HTML).
*Update parts of the web page dynamically based on the server's response.


`````````The Role of XML and JSON```````
AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) was originally designed to use XML 
for data exchange between a client (browser) and a server.

However, modern AJAX implementations mostly use JSON,
 which does not rely on XML at all.


Key Differences:
XML and JSON Are Separate Formats:
XML (Extensible Markup Language) and JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) 
are two distinct ways to structure and exchange data.

They serve the same purpose but work differently:

XML: Tag-based, hierarchical structure, verbose.

JSON: Key-value pairs, lightweight, and designed for simplicity.

AJAX Doesn't Require XML:

The "XML" in AJAX is a historical term. AJAX doesn't inherently 
depend on XML—it can work with any data format, including JSON, 
plain text, or even HTML.

Modern JSON vs. XML:

JSON has largely replaced XML in modern web development due to its simplicity and speed. It’s not that JSON uses XML—it’s a completely different format that achieves the same goal (data exchange) more efficiently.

Why JSON Is Faster and Lighter:
Structure: JSON has a simple key-value format, while XML uses a tag-based structure that adds extra overhead.

Parsing: JSON integrates natively with JavaScript, so it's parsed quickly without additional tools. XML requires more processing steps for parsing.

Size: JSON data is typically smaller than equivalent XML data, which reduces bandwidth and improves performance.

Summary:
JSON does not use XML—it has replaced XML in many cases because it is more efficient for data exchange. AJAX programming today typically works with JSON, and the "XML" in AJAX is now just a historical artifact. JSON is independent of XML and offers faster and lighter data handling for modern web applications.
