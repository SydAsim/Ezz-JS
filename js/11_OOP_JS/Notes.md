# JavaScript and classes
So we  might think that classes ANd OOP methods are 
important in JS just like JAVA and C++ but its just 
a programming paradiam(the way programmers preferto write a code ) 
JS has Classes concept JS is protype based Language
it classes are Primarily synthetic sugar over 
prototype based inheritance mechanism

which means it basically provide a clean structure for 
Programmers comming from the Class based Languages like 
C++ , JAVA etc 
but underthehood it works somewhat differently 

## OOP => just a process Structure / 
Objects in JS 
collections of Properties and methods
- toLowercase etc Promises 

#  why use OOP?

# parts of OOP 
- object literals {}
- construction functions ()
- Protypes 
- classes
- Inheritance (new , this)

## Pillers of  OOP 
- Abstraction 
- Encapsulation 
- Inheritance
- Polymorphasim

1-Abstraction :
Abstraction involves hiding the complex implementation details of an object and exposing only the essential features to the user. This helps to reduce complexity and increase efficiency.


2-Encapsulation : 
Encapsulation means bundling the data (variables) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit (class). It also allows restricting direct access to some of the object's components (e.g., using private or _ prefix for private variables).


3-Inheritance :
Inheritance allows one class (child class) to inherit the properties and methods of another class (parent class). It promotes code reuse

4-Polymorphism : 
Polymorphism means "many forms" and allows methods in different classes to have the same name but behave differently based on the context.
